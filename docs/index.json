In this paper, a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for both hand gesture recognition and fingertip detection are introduced. The proposed algorithm uses a single network to predict finger class probabilities and fingertips positional output in one evaluation. Instead of directly regressing fingertips position from the fully connected layer of the CNN, we regress ensemble of fingertips position from the fully convolutional network (FCN) and subsequently take ensemble average to regress the final fingertips positional output. Since the whole recognition and detection pipeline use a single network, it is extremely fast, runs at 76 frames per second. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method makes less localization error and less likely to predict false positive and false negative. It outperforms other fingertip detection approach including Heatmap-based and End2End frameworks.","tags":null,"title":"Unified Convolutional Neural Network Approach of Gesture Recognition and Fingertip Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Mahmudul Alam","S.

The first-stage CNN is assigned to detect and locate the hand. Subsequently, the detected hand is cropped, resized, and fed to the second stage CNN for predicting the coordinates of fingertips. Next, a tracker is employed to track the hand continuously so that the system becomes reliable in real-time performance. The VR environments are designed to demonstrate the performance of the fingertipbased interaction system. The proposed method focuses on the geometric transformation of a virtual 3D object by using the gesture of the thumb and index finger. In particular, the distance of the thumb and index fingertips is employed to scale a 3D object in virtual environment. To realize the system, a dataset of 1000 images, named, Thumb Index 1000 (TI1K) dataset, is developed including those variations that are commonly-seen in real-life thumb and index fingers. The system is evaluated with the aid of a number of participants and virtual objects that are distinctive in nature. The proposed approach attains the desired goal and performs in real-time seamlessly to facilitate the humancomputer interaction in the VR environment.","tags":null,"title":"Detection and Tracking of Fingertips for Geometric Transformation of Objects in Virtual Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Mahmudul Alam","Mohammad Tariqul Islam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556841600,"objectID":"a32f1c03d0bf9eb99b714e124d380efa","permalink":"https://mahmudulalam.github.io/publication/blood-cell-detection/","publishdate":"2019-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blood-cell-detection/","section":"publication","summary":"A complete blood cell count is an important test in medical diagnosis to evaluate overall health condition. Traditionally blood cells are counted manually using haemocytometer along with other laboratory equipment’s and chemical compounds, which is a time-consuming and tedious task. In this work, the authors present a machine learning approach for automatic identification and counting of three types of blood cells using ‘you only look once’ (YOLO) object detection and classification algorithm. YOLO framework has been trained with a modified configuration BCCD Dataset of blood smear images to automatically identify and count red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Moreover, this study with other convolutional neural network architectures considering architecture complexity, reported accuracy, and running time with this framework and compare the accuracy of the models for blood cells detection. They also tested the trained model on smear images from a different dataset and found that the learned models are generalised. Overall the computer-aided system of detection and counting enables us to count blood cells from smear images in less than a second, which is useful for practical applications.","tags":null,"title":"Machine learning approach of automatic identification and counting of blood cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516665600,"objectID":"054c306a97245ca0b14fccb02271c4d5","permalink":"https://mahmudulalam.github.io/project/image-classification/","publishdate":"2018-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/image-classification/","section":"project","summary":"A convolutional neural network approach to classify image using the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.","tags":null,"title":"Image Classification Using CNN","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476230400,"objectID":"cd60124cfeaa7301a19e4db859c8014e","permalink":"https://mahmudulalam.github.io/project/probability-distribution/","publishdate":"2016-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/probability-distribution/","section":"project","summary":"Calculate and visualize the probability distribution of univariate or bivariate data directly from Excel file using MATLAB.","tags":null,"title":"Probability Distribution Using GUI","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bfb3bfcf3e631e2fdc842237400425c7","permalink":"https://mahmudulalam.github.io/project/digi-comm/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/digi-comm/","section":"project","summary":"Simulation of the entire digital communication system with different modulation schemeto transmit and receive text messages in MATLAB.","tags":null,"title":"A Complete Digital Communication System","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1e098d64eda626c2ae45fc59355722a","permalink":"https://mahmudulalam.github.io/project/heart-rate-tracking/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/heart-rate-tracking/","section":"project","summary":"Implementation of the window method and template matching methods to calculate and track the heartrate and comparison of their performance.","tags":null,"title":"Heart Rate Tracking","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"251b4950df1f61e934fed6e1c3030851","permalink":"https://mahmudulalam.github.io/project/microputer/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/microputer/","section":"project","summary":"Microputer: An Arduino based programmable micro computer.","tags":null,"title":"Microputer","type":"project"}]
